## What is the content area?
Recent advancement in technology has affecting energy industry[<sup>1</sup>](#1) in many ways, particularly resulting in a massive amount of data aquisition and processing across end-to-end value chains on a continuous basis through the application of sensors, wireless transmission, network communication, and cloud computing technologies. Such a high volume, velocity and variety of information assets termed as Big Data (reference) must be managed efficiently to generate value from data. However, most organisations in the industry are facing challenges with Dark Data – the term coined by Gartner Inc. to describe the information assets that organisations collect, process and store in regular business activities, yet are of little or no avail for other purposes such as business analytics and direct monetizing.

## What are the "defining elements" of the project
Unambiguously, due to the disparate nature of data and technologies employed, the business consumers of that data from heterogeneous database systems (including data-warehouses and data-lakes) often encounter difficulties when aggregating and coalescing data. The primary consequence of ineffective big data and knowledge management i.e. when the organisations are unable to efficiently leverage its big data, is loss in competetive advantage which in turn comes at a cost. For example, at the upstream end of energy sector, delayed decision making in prospect evaluation during business acquisition will bring to loss of investment whereas at the downstream extremity, ineffective monitoring of energy production and utilisation will incur unnecessary cost to the consumers.

## What is the scope of the project?
How to improve discovery, exploration & analysis of organizational 'dark data' with the aim of maximizing derived value, in the most timely manner, to facilitate best possible decision-making?

The proposal will be aligned with the Big Data Management Canvas (BDMC) proposed Kaufmann (2019) – a reference model for big data applications in an organisation for value creating from data by aligning business goals with technical implementation.

### Solution(s)
We will investigate a numer of (potential) solutions, including ...

#### 'Universal' query language(s)
As a solution, we will look into the creation of universal query language(s) for accessing the heterogeneous database systems – an adaptation of the existing query language(s) to retrieve the big data in an energy sector. 

#### Real-time event streaming

As an alternative to storing as-is (with no filtering) and processing persisted data using batch operations (e.g. traditional ETL process), real-time event streaming provides opportunities for optimising the flow of data and re-acting more quickly to events. For instance ...
- incoming streams (of data) can immediately be filtered, to discard unnecessary data, without first being persisted.
- event/action triggers can operate directly on data streams, rather than scheduled cron-style jobs polling for data.
